#+Title: Release Sprint: 3-Week Roll Call; List of Use Cases
#+INCLUDE: "./org/header.org-in" org

* About this Sprint
  This is a /release sprint/. This means that you package things that you have done in other sprints in order to create a release (an assignment delivery). You are expected to integrate what you have learnt previously and test/evaluate your release candidate to maximise your potential for passing the assignment.

  This particular release sprint also serves as the three week roll call in the course. *Please Note* that if you do not submit this release on time, you will be deregistered from the course.
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As the government, we want to make sure that all students registered on a course are also active in the course so that we do not pay the university too much.
* Course Goals for this Sprint
- (PA1415) på en grundläggande nivå i grupp kunna ta fram krav på en programvara och uttrycka dem i en kravspecifikation.

*Kunskap och förståelse*
 - (PA1435, PA1434, PA1443) kunna visa förståelse för grundläggande principer i objektorienterad programvaruutveckling.
* Introduction
  The idea with this release sprint is that I should see who is active in the course. I will at the same time take the opportunity to briefly look at your initial efforts regarding the assignment series so that I may possibly steer you in a more productive direction.

  A reasonable effort for this assignment is between 1/2 to 1 hour. Just read the system description and brainstorm a list of 5-15 processes that a user may do with the system (i.e. UML use cases). Add one or two sentences describing each of these use cases, package it up in a PDF and submit.

  This submission can be seen as a starting point for the next submission where you take this initial list of use cases and continue your analysis, and expand the descriptions of your found use cases.
* Learning Material

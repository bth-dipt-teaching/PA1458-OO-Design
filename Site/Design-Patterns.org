#+Title: Design Patterns
#+INCLUDE: "./org/header.org-in" org


* About This Sprint
  This sprint extends upon the previous sprints on constructing a /good/ design with the help of previously tried and tested solutions, so called /Design Patterns/.
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As a software designer I want to create a design that adheres to basic design principles so that I am sure that it will "hold" when I add more functionality and start maintaining the system.
  - As a software desginer I want to be able to use previously tested solutions where applicable so that I do not have to reinvent the wheel for every problem.
* Introduction
   Object Oriented software design has been around for some time now. Over the years, certain problem types have appeared again and again, and over time common solutions to these problems evolved under the name /Design Patterns/. A design pattern is a tried and tested solution for a recurring design problem, that assigns roles and responsibilities to each class in a group of collaborating classes.

   A currently common philosophy for software construction is "Get the functionality right first, design support for your quality requirements later". While I am not sure I fully agree with this, this is the mentality that e.g. test-driven development leads to (even if it may not be explicitly said). Jan Bosch [[http://www.pearsoned.co.uk/bookshop/detail.asp?affid=gbs&t=683&item=100000000004774][suggests something similar]] when it comes to software architecture design. I think this is a useful philosophy, but only to a certain extent. I think that unless you have created your design with /some/ awareness of the quality requirements you have, and with /some/ awareness and control over how to create a design that can meet these requirements, the necessary refactoring is going to be very difficult if not impossible. This is why it is important to be aware of common design principles and design patterns.

   You have already studied the first building block to achieve good designs with the GRASP patterns from {{{larman}}}. These basic design principles do not target any specific quality attribute or any specific problem or problem type, but are generic principles in order to set a good foundation for your design. The next building block is to look at groups of interacting classes, and good design principles for getting these groups of classes to work together to solve specific problems. The last building block is the software architecture, which is discussed in other sprints.

   The design patterns discussed in {{{larman}}} is a subset of the ones in the so-called "Gang of Four"-book [fn:GoFBook:E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, and J. Vlissides. /Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Languages and Systems./ Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1994.] (Listed in Table [[tab:GoFPatterns]]). These are a good starting point. I warmly recommend you to buy the GoF book as well and glance through the patterns so you have a rough idea of all the patterns in this book. This will help you to quickly recognise when you can solve a problem with a particular design pattern.

   | Pattern          | Brief Problem Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
   |------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Adapter          | You want to use one interface, but your code provides another, or another version.                                                                                                               |
   | Factory          | You need a transparent way to create objects of the right type.                                                                                                                                  |
   | Singleton        | You have a resource that is shared across your entire application and which must be kept unique, but can not/do not want/your software design teacher has told you not to/ use a global variable |
   |                  | (Note, a global variable would not solve the "unique access" problem anyway)                                                                                                                     |
   | Strategy         | You need a way to (possibly at runtime) change an algorithm depending on some circumstances.                                                                                                     |
   | Composite        | In your system, the same strategies should be applied to individual entities as to some, defined, groupings of entities.                                                                         |
   | Facade           | You have different implementations or interfaces that you wish to hide from the users of your API.                                                                                               |
   | Observer         | You want to be able to add new parts to your system that should be notified of changes in another part, without having to go in there and hard-code the notification all the time.               |
   | Proxy            | You do not want to directly access a resource, for a number of reasons.                                                                                                                          |
   | Abstract Factory | Your homegrown Factory pattern just blew up in your face and you need a more scalable solution.                                                                                                  |

   The thing with design patterns, which I cannot stress enough, is that they are /proven/ solutions to /common/ problems. It's not just "I googled for this problem, and a random dude at StackOverflow got lots of votes for this solution, so I am going to cargo-cult it into my own application without understanding the consequences of solving my problem in this way". Each solution has /known/ consequences in terms of the effect on a number of quality attributes (modifiability in particular).

   Moreover, once you decide to solve your problem using a particular design pattern, you can annotate your design to say that you are indeed using Design Pattern X. You may even use UML Stereotypes to annotate your individual classes in your design with both the pattern name as well as each class' role in the pattern. The benefit of this is that other software developers will recognise what pattern you are using, will understand the roles and responsibilities, and will know how to extend or modify it. Even if you do not explicitly annotate your design the role-names tend to become embedded into the class names such that a good designer will recognise the design patterns anyway.

#+BEGIN_info
*TL;DR:* Design Patterns help you re-use proven solutions to commonly recurring problems. It also helps you and other developers to understand the design.
#+END_info

    I would also like to point out that you normally do not use design patterns in isolation. Rather, you nest usage of design patterns inside each other, and you typically even use some design patterns to construct others (the /Observer/ pattern is notoriously used as a building block of other patterns, as is the /Facade/ and /Proxy/ patterns depending on how you look at things). There are also some patterns which are very similar in nature (for example, the /Strategy/ pattern and the /State/ pattern). 

** When to apply Design Patterns
    The next question is /when/ should you start thinking of design patterns? I have partially answered this by saying that you should always be aware of common design patterns so that they become a natural way to think of roles and responsibilities when designing.

    The next point is when you are creating your UML interaction diagrams, and are deciding how a certain interaction should "play out". The problem is that it is rather difficult to recognise design patterns here, so I would suggest that you back up a bit first. Go back to your UML Domain Model. Reflect upon the feature you are currently trying to design, and which concepts from your domain model might be involved.

    - Are there any shared resources (might /Singleton/ be a good idea)?
    - Do you need to shelter yourself e.g. from an external party or resource (can you hide this behind an /Adapter/ or a /Proxy/)?
    - Can you structure the data hierarchically (Would /Composite/ help)?
    - Do you need to create new objects according to some business rule (can you encode this in a /Factory/ or an /Abstract Factory/)?

    This will at least put the embryos for design patterns in place. However, this will probably also require you to think slightly further than just the UML interaction diagram you are currently designing, or the UML use case you are currently working on, or even the current sprint. Most design patterns are solutions to how to seamlessly add new or alternative functionality, and when you are designing one particular use case or interaction diagram you should first be focusing on creating /one/ functional flow without any concern for alternative flows (Yes, they are there in the UML use case description, and you should take care of them in your interaction diagrams too, but the workflow is to "do the main flow first, /then/ do the alternative flows"), so you may not see the need for a design pattern when you are designing for the first iteration.
    
    The benefit of at least spending some thought about design patterns early on is that it will make your life easier later, because you already have the scaffolding in place to extend with more functionality.

    The /danger/ is that you add structure that may not be required. It certainly is not required for your current iteration. In the eyes of Lean software development, this is a /waste/, and just helps to create a technical debt. You have added structure that needs to be maintained, and needs to be understood before any maintenance is done, but which is not used to deliver any actual value to your customers.

    So a better approach is to /plunge on/ instead of backing up. Do your interaction diagrams. Extract a minimum viable class diagram therefrom, and /only then/ think about what commonalities and variations you have between different interaction diagrams and how you may resolve these commonalities and variations with the help of design patterns.

    Then you go back and revise your interaction diagrams accordingly. Remember that at this stage refactoring is cheap since you only have "paper products" to work with.

** A Word of Warning
   I would like to end this section with a word of warning: It is easy to go overboard with design patterns.

   [[./images/IDPAllthethings.jpg]]


   Some colleagues of mine once took a small system that consisted of a handful of classes and started refactoring with the help of design patterns. They stopped when they had 30-odd classes, and I am not sure that any of the qualities they had started out optimising for could be detected in the system anymore (I don't think this was a major concern for them, though, since the primary goal of the exercise was to see how many classes you would get if you kept on adding design patterns).

   First of all, many design patterns solve similar problems so if you have one design pattern in place, chances are that you have at least partially addressed many of the concerns you had.

   Second, you will not resolve any underlying problems just by throwing more design patterns at your system. If the system is broken, more design patterns will not help.

   Third, this is why you should start out lean. Only address your immediate concerns. Refactor later if you still have unsolved issues.

   However, in order to decide which design patterns are /minimally/ necessary, you need to know about /many/ design patterns so you can make an informed decision between them.

   Go through the user stories for this sprint and make sure you have a clear understanding of how to solve each of them.

   Revisit and update your risks and contingencies section.

   Add and/or revise the following items to your glossary:
   - Design Pattern
     - Adapter
     - Factory
     - Singleton
     - Strategy
     - State
     - Composite
     - Facade

   - Stereotypes
   - Interface, and Abstract Class

   Make sure you understand what each item is, the notation for them, and how to use them either in isolation or together with the other concepts.    
** Update Course Backlog
   As the system grows, is there a way to structure the bigger building blocks of a system? Package diagrams show how the implementation artefacts are structured, but how would you express the dynamic behaviour on a package level? What about exploring high-level concepts of a large software system? Are there patterns similar to design patterns that deal with systems and sub-systems?
   
   Are there any other questions that you want answered? Add them, along with a brief strategy for how to find an answer.    
* Sprint Acceptance Tests
  You are done with this sprint when:
  - You have reviewed the Design Patterns in {{{larman}}} and have a general understanding of which problems they try to solve, and how to structure a solution in accordance with each design pattern.
  - You have considered your current design and identified design patterns that may be useful to you.

  you may also have
  - Updated your Sprint Test Plan
  - Updated your Course Backlog

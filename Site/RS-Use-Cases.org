#+Title: Release Sprint: Use Cases
#+INCLUDE: "./org/header.org-in" org


* About this Sprint
  This is a /release sprint/. This means that you package things that you have done in other sprints in order to create a release (an assignment delivery). You are expected to integrate what you have learnt previously and test/evaluate your release candidate to maximise your potential for passing the assignment.

  This release sprint also serves as a checkpoint to make sure that you are reasonably well underway in the course, and that you are on the right track. Any feedback received on this assignment should be used to adjust your plans for the remaining releases to make sure you deliver the right thing at the right time.
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As a teacher I want to evaulate the students' ability to write well-formed UML Use Cases for a system so that I know that they fulfil the course goal concerning requirements engineering.
* Course Goals covered in this Sprint
*Kunskap och förståelse* Efter genomförd kurs ska studenten:
 - (PA1435, PA1434, PA1443) kunna visa förståelse för grundläggande principer i objektorienterad programvaruutveckling.
 - (PA1435, PA1434) kunna visa förståelse för UML som modelleringsspråk.
 - (PA1435, PA1434, PA1443) kunna visa kunskap om grundläggande designprinciper.
* Introduction
  In this release sprint you show what you have done with respect to requirements analysis and object oriented analysis.

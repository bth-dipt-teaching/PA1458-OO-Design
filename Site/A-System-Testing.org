* About this Sprint
  In this sprint you create a test plan for your system.
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As a teacher I want to evaluate the students' ability to test an implemented system according to a test plan so that I know they understand how to translate a design to a test plan and how to execute this test plan.

#+Title: Release Sprint: Software Architecture and Testing
#+INCLUDE: "./org/header.org-in" org


* About this Sprint
  This is a /release sprint/. This means that you package things that you have done in other sprints in order to create a release (an assignment delivery). You are expected to integrate what you have learnt previously and test/evaluate your release candidate to maximise your potential for passing the assignment.
* User Stories covered in this Sprint
  - As a teacher I want to evaluate the students' ability to "raise" a detailed design into a workable software architecture solution so that I know they fulfil the corresponding course goals.
  - As a teacher I want to evaluate the students' ability to "raise" a detailed design into a workable software architecture solution so that I know they have an understanding of software architecture solutions and how they work.
  - As a teacher I want to evaluate the students' ability to test an implemented system according to a test plan so that I know they understand how to translate a design to a test plan and how to execute this test plan.
* Course Goals covered in this Sprint
  - (PA1415, PA1443) på en grundläggande nivå i grupp kunna planera och genomföra testning av producerad programvara, baserat på en kravspecifikation.

  *Kunskap och Förståelse*
  - (PA1443) kunna visa kunskap om grundläggande mjukvaruarkitekturstilar.

  *Färdigheter och förmåga*
  - (PA1443) kunna tillämpa grundläggande arkitekturstilar för ett mjukvarusystem.
  - (PA1443) kunna resonera om de kvalitetsegenskaper ett system med en viss arkitekturstil har eller bör ha.
  - (PA1443) kunna resonera om och skapa en grundläggande testplan för ett objektorienterat system.

  *Värderingsförmåga och förhållningssätt*
  - (PA1434, PA1435, PA1443) kunna analysera och kritiskt diskutera en design för eventuella förbättringar.

3. [@3] Test Strategy
   - Describe your test strategy:
     - What types of tests will you run?
     - When will you run them?
     - According to what rules will you run and re-run your tests?
     - Which parts of your tests will be automated, and which parts will be manual?
     - What tools will you use for automated testing?
     - How will you ensure that as much as possible of your system is tested?
       - How will you calculate your test coverage?
4. System Tests
   - Describe your system tests:
     - What are your test items?
     - Which features do you plan on testing?
       - How?
       - When?
       - Rules for testing and re-testing the feature?
     - What is the test environment for each feature test (entry and exit criteria)?
     - What are pass/fail criteria for each feature test?
     - What are your test deliverables for each feature test?

When marking this part of the assignment we are looking for the following:

0. [@0] Does the title page contain a table with authors and author contribution
1. Size of assignment: Are there 5-10 features to be tested?
2. Scope of assignment: Does the test strategy contain a mixture of exploratory testing and regression testing techniques?
3. Do the described system tests match the described test strategy?
4. Is there a clear test strategy that will exercise relevant parts of the system?

** Assignment Submission   
   {{{submit}}}
   
   Your submission shall include the following documents:
   - System Test Plan
   - Software Architecture and Architecture Tactics
* Sprint Acceptance Tests
  You are done with this sprint when:
  - [[./org/checked.png]] You have submitted the documents for marking.
  - [[./org/checked.png]] You have received a passing grade from the teacher.

  You may be asked to complement your submission with additional information.

  You may also have:
  - Updated your Sprint Test Plan
  - Updated your Course Backlog

  This is a portal for the courses on Object Oriented Analysis and Design offered by Blekinge Institute of Technology.

  For each course there is a path through the available material that describes what you should do and your schedule. Please make sure that you use the right path, since deliveries and deadlines may differ between the paths.

  Start with the [[./Sprint0-course-intro.org][first sprint (Sprint 0 - Course Introduction)]] to get an overview of the course and how to understand the course structure. This also serves as the official Course PM.

  Then, please use the appropriate start page for your course as listed below:

There is a  [[https://gitter.im/BTH-SE/OODesign][Gitter room]] which I will monitor during the course if you have any questions or would like to discuss anything related to object oriented design. We will also use this channel for some online seminars.

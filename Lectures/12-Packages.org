- /Conceptual view/
- Logical breakdown into system components
- Each component represent some group of functionality
- Each component may have several interfaces, used by other components.
- Each component may in turn consist of other, smaller, components.

- *Each Component has a description of its responsibilities*

* Modules

- /Module/ or /Package/ view.
- A Package may contain other packages
- A Package may contain classes
- This is closer to what you are going to implement.
- A Package /may/ end up as a sub-directory in your filesystem, or a namespace.
- The packages start out by mimicking the conceptual components, but may evolve from there.

- *Each package has a description of its responsibilities*

* Execution

title Execution View
package Client <<Node>> {
package UserInterface {
}
}

package Server <<Node>> {
package BusinessLogic {
}

package Logging {
}

package DBInterface {
}

}

package Database <<Database>> {
}

Client -- Server
Server -- Database
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:FUML-Execution.png]]

- Each block is one execution unit
  - one compiled binary
  - may be run as a separate process or on a separate computer
- Each block contains packages
- Sometimes, parts of a package need to be split across execution units
  - this means that we may have to go back to the module view and create new packages.

* Get Started
1. Create a Component for each major piece of functionality
2. Create Packages for classes that deal with similar concepts
3. Create Packages for support functions (e.g. storage, events, etc.)

** Patterns -- a brief introduction
  - Design patterns are reusable solutions to known problems
    - With known consequences
    - "encoded experience"
    - Codified in a structured format
    - named
  - There is nothing that /requires/ you to use design patterns; they are a convenience.
  - Design patterns focus primarily on structure (class view), and interaction (sequence diagrams).

 *Responsibility Driven Design*

** Levels of Patterns
   Different levels:
   - Architecture
     - Systems, subsystems
   - Design
     - Classes, groups of classes
   - Idioms
     - One class, functions within one class
   - GRASP
     - In some sense orthogonal
     - Learning aid for OO Design
     - Advice for Assigning Responsibilities
** Some Common Design Patterns
From Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., & Vlissides, J., /Design
patterns: elements of reusable object-oriented languages and systems/
(1994), Reading MA: Addison-Wesley.

  1. Strategy
  2. State
  3. Observer
  4. Facade && Adapter
  5. Abstract Facory
  6. Builder
  7. Command
  8. Interpreter
  9. Visitor

   - Low Coupling
   - High Cohesion
   - Information Expert
   - Creator
   - Controller
   - Polymorphism
   - Indirection
   - Pure Fabrication
   - Protected Variations
* Design Patterns
** Strategy
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: Owner, DefinedInterface, ConcreteImplementation
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-strategy.png
#+END_SRC
*** Example
#+NOTES: Ghost, MovementStrategy, Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-strategy-example.png
#+END_SRC
** State
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: Owner, DefinedInterface, ConcreteImplementation
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-state.png
#+END_SRC
*** Example
#+NOTES: Pacman, PacmanState (makeSound(), encounterGhost()), NormalState, SuperState, pass through of methods + encounterSuperCandy()
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-state-example.png
#+END_SRC
** Observer
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: Observer, Observable, DataPublisher, DataSubscriber
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-observer.png
#+END_SRC
*** Example
#+NOTES: copy from above + Pacman, Ghost
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-observer-example.png
#+END_SRC
** Abstract Factory
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: Owner, AbstractFactory (getInstanceOfX(), …Y()) , ConcreteFactory…
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-absfact.png
#+END_SRC
*** Example 1
#+NOTES: Owner, InferfaceGenerator (createButton(), createTextField()), WindowsGenerator, MacGenerator
#+NOTES: AbstractButton, WindowsButton, MacButton   relations:creates
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-absfact-ex1.png
#+END_SRC
*** Example 2
#+NOTES: Game, SceneGenerator (createObjectsInScene()), MainMenuGenerator, GameGenerator, HighscoreGenerator
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-absfact-ex2.png

#+END_SRC
** Singleton
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: abstract class, private constructor, getInstance() etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-singleton.png
#+END_SRC
*** getInstance()
#+BEGIN_SRC cpp
#+END_SRC
** Facade, Wrapper, Adapter
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: +wrapper
#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :file DP-wrapper.png
package AllOfMySystem { }

Package EvilChangingComponent { }
#+END_SRC
** Interpreter
*** Generic Structure
#+NOTES: Expression (interpret() ), IfExpr, AndExpr, TerminalExpr
#+begin_src plantuml :file DP-Interpreter.png

#+end_src
*** Example
Lisp grammar:
  - sexpr :: list || atom
  - list :: '(' sexpr* ')'
  - atom :: number || symbol
  - number :: [0-9]+
  - symbol :: ^[()]+

Let's parse an expression: ~(if (= 0 some-variable) (+ 10 20 30) (call-some-function 20))~

* Design Antipatterns
- Design Patterns == Solutions to commonly recurring problems
- Programming *antipatterns* == What *not* to do.
- High and low, ranging from process, to design, to programming
** Design Antpattern Examples
Process antipatterns
- Premature optimisation :: Optimising your code before you know if, when, and where a particular quality attribute is going to be a problem.
- Bikeshedding :: Spend time discussing the /colour/ of the bikeshed instead of figuring out whether you really need a bikeshed in the first place.
- Analysis Paralysis :: The most perfect analysis in the world is useless unless you have actually built the system. /Good enough/ is often plenty.
- Gold Plating :: Adding things to your project/design/code that might someday come in handy even if no-one has ever asked for it -- or is willing to pay for it.


Design antipatterns
- The God class :: The one central class that knows too much about the rest of the system, with too many dependencies and responsibilities.
- Fear of adding classes :: More classes doth not always a more complex design make.


Programming antipatterns
- Magic Numbers and Strings :: string and number literals that are thrown into the middle of the code means that it is (a) more difficult to find them when they change, and (b) there is no encoded decision rationale what thet mean. Use a constant instead.
- Copypasta :: When you copy code from one function to another that /almost/ do the same thing, you are creating twice the maintenance headache.
* Security Antipatterns
- Pardon the Malintent :: You should use the same standard of throwing exceptions and notifications when you detect a hacking attempt as in your own code. If you can't open a file, you throw an exception so that the user can know about it (hopefully you do not terminate unless it is critical), but if you notice a hacking attempt you just swallow it without even logging the attempt?
- Incomplete Mediation :: When you authenticate some types of requests (the common ones), but forget other access routes.
- Insufficient Knowledge of Protocols :: Just because you have never seen a HTTP request/response (it is fully possible to implement a whole web application without evver seeing one), it doesn't mean that the hacker doesn't know how to exploit it. Do you know how all parameters in the HTTP header are treated in your application?-
- Secure Library Ignorance :: Make sure you security audit any third party libraries that you use. This includes all third party libraries, not just the ones you think might be at risk.
- Mixing Code and Data :: Make sure that all and any inputs are sanitised before you concatenate them into a a string that is going to be executed. Fun fact: Did you know that someone voted for =pwn'); DROP TABLE VOTERS;--= in the 2010 Swedish elections?
- Confirmation Bias :: We all have blind spots where we assume but do not verify certain things. In security engineering, this can be particularly problematic.

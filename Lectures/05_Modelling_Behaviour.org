      Classroom:
      - Going from Use Case to Sequence Diagram
      - System Sequence Diagram vs regular Sequence Diagram
      - System as a modelling concept
      - Contracts
	- What are they?
	- How should you interpret preconditions?
	- How to interpret postconditions?
	- Stage-and-Curtain execution
      - Discuss:
	- What are extended contracts good for?
      - State Diagrams
	- Examples + Discussion: Common Pitfalls
	- What types of Events can there be in a state diagram?
      - Discuss:
	- How do we fit state diagrams into the UML process?

<h3 id="orgheadline7"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Introduction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Before you start designing your system, you need to find out <i>what</i> to design and build. There are of course different ways of doing this. The traditional way advocates that you need to fully understand the entire system before you go ahead with the design (cf. <i>waterfall development</i>), whereas at the other end the agile approach (e.g. as advocated by <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">eXtreme Programming</a> and the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>) is that you should only do as much requirements engineering up front as is necessary to understand how to start building, since the requirements are going to change anyway. Note that they do not say &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;; they say &ldquo;Do as little as possible, but not less&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
It is thus important to decide early how much requirements engineering you should do before you start with the project. Incidentally, there is a difference between the traditional, so called <i>bespoke</i> requirements engineering where you start a project when a customer knocks on the door and then you do requirements engineering as part of that project, and the <i>continuous</i> requirements engineering where you always do requirements engineering and spawn new development projects as a result of the requirements engineering process. The latter suits the type of products that you develop and sell to more than one customer, while the former is more suitable for one-off projects. For this course, I would suggest a pragmatic approach (akin to the agile way): Do as much requirements engineering so that you have a rough overview of what the system should do, and do proper requirements engineering on what you need to know do make a Minimum Viable Product. 
</p>

<p>
There are many sources and techniques for doing requirements elicitation (i.e., finding the requirements), from reading the old documentation, analysing competitor&rsquo;s products, interviewing users, running surveys among user groups, or simply inventing the requirements yourself. If you do requirements engineering you will be using a mixture of these. Typically, you will start by doing an unstructured interview with a manager to get a broad overview of what they want the system to do. You will then try to define end user groups and find a couple of representative persons from each user group and conduct further interviews with them. At first, these interviews will be exploratory and unstructured, but will pretty soon become semi-structured as you learn about the major features of the system, so that you will be getting further details about each of these major features.
</p>

<p>
Finding out who may have an interest in the system (a <i>stakeholder</i>) is so important that I have even added a separate user story for it in this sprint. This is not limited to end-users. Other stakeholders may include (but is not limited to): the organisation that is going to maintain and continue development of the system, system service technicians that will be doing backups and adding users and other running maintenance, external parties that you may connect to (for example banks to deal with payments), legal texts (that&rsquo;s right: a text can be a stakeholder), other departments in the organisation you build for that require your system to jack in with their processes, and so on.

<h4 id="orgheadline3"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Interviews</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve already touched upon elicitation techniques. The one you are likely to use the most is <i>Interviews</i>. &ldquo;Interview&rdquo; is actually a cover-all phrase that encompasses a whole range of different techniques that involves two people or more with (at least) voice contact. You <i>may</i> thus do interviews over phone, but I would not recommend it since you loose a lot of nuances that can be learnt by observing body language. Video conference or face-to-face meetings IRL are the most common interview settings. You can be one person interviewing one other person, or there can be more people either doing the interview or being interviewed (although at some point it is perhaps better to run the meeting as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group">focus group</a>).
</p>

<p>
In its most simple form, you conduct the interview as an <i>open interview</i> with <i>open answers</i>. In this setting, you basically just talk, and together explore what the application should do. You rarely have the luxury to be this unstructured, even in the first interview. I would recommend you to do as much homework as possible beforehand so that you have at least a small set of starting questions that you can use to get the interview going and to get back on track when you feel that you have diverged too far from the interview goals. Having a set of questions moves the interview into a <i>semi-structured</i> format, where you are able to follow up on the answers given with further impromptu questions. The extreme is a <i>structured</i> interview where you have a specific set of questions that you want answered in a particular order without room for any further probing. This is typically only used in research contexts.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, you can allow <i>open answers</i>, typically early on when you want to explore and look for new information, or you can restrict the answers to a <i>closed answer</i> space, where each question can e.g. be answered with one of four alternatives. This is good for confirming what you have previously learnt; you can collect answers from larger groups of people and quickly analyse them, and the idea is that at that stage you should not expect to find any new information.
</p>

<p>
Thus, a requirements engineer will probably use semi-structured open answered interviews. In this course, however, this will not be the case as it would be out of scope for the course. You will instead have to create the requirements yourself (more on this under the Experiential Learning in this sprint).
</p>

<p>
How you behave during an interview influences the results, because your behaviour can make the interview subjects more or less prone to answer your questions. In Table <a href="#orgtable1">1</a> I have compiled a list of do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts in interview situations (we have actually used this list to assess requirements elicitation interviews in the requirements engineering courses at BTH).

Once you have found the requirements, your next step (after analysing them and negotiating them with the customer, but that is also outside the scope of this course) is to <i>Specify</i> the requirements. There is an IEEE standard, <a href="#orgspecialblock1">IEEE 830</a>, for how to structure your requirements document, assuming you specify requirements in the traditional way. The good thing about this is that it has existed for many years, and people are used to seeing it and signing contract based on it. The bad thing about it is that it is not as well known or easy to understand as requirements engineering researchers would like to think it is, and with a few moments of education I am certain that you will be able to educate your customers on any document and requirements format you choose.

To simplify, there are two plus one ways of writing requirements. The two ways are traditional requirements and user stories. The plus one way is UML use cases. UML:ists themselves claim that use cases are not requirments, they are merely scenarios where one or several requirements are &ldquo;exercised&rdquo;. I would rather avoid re-formatting the requirements once more and just add more documentation that will only be used once, so I would try very hard to get away with only documenting the requirements within the context of a use case if I must use them.
</p>


<div id="orgparagraph2" class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/FRESpecification.png" alt="FRESpecification.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2:</span> Two plus one way of specifying requirements</p>
</div>

<p>
Traditional requirements may be specified as figures, tables, sketches, or plaintext, with the plaintext version being the one most commonly discussed. They usually follow a standardised format with a number of attributes per requirement (title, description, source, date, etc.), and a standardised template for the actual requirement. User Stories are supposed to be less documentation so they try to include the most relevant of all of this information into a single one-liner. Shorter iterations, a more direct path from inception to implementation, and closer collaboration with the customer makes it easier to do away with a lot of the information considered necessary in traditional requirements.
</p>

<p>
UML use cases are covered in a different course sprint, so I will only briefly mention them here. With a use case, you are attempting to put the requirements into a context. Of course, this means that you need to write more, since you also need to add information about the context. This is one of the reasons why they are not considered requirements &#x2013; they are simply too verbose. This verbosity also means that a developer is unlikely to do use cases for every requirement and every part of the system; but will rather do them for those parts of the system where there is a usage flow that is difficult to grasp in one sentence, and where you are likely to hold a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; with the system to fulfill a higher need. For example, searching for a hotel room is a one-liner. <i>Booking</i> a room on the other hand may involve
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a search</li>
<li>a narrowing of the results to specific types of rooms</li>
<li>a check whether the room is available</li>
<li>a selection of the room</li>
<li>input of information about the person booking the room, and</li>
<li>a confirmation that the room is booked.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each of these items may, in turn, comprise more than several requirements, including at least one requirement that restricts the order in which these actions must be performed.
</p>

<h4 id="orgheadline5"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.3</span> Prioritisation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-3">

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/I0Programmer.jpg" alt="I0Programmer.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So, which requirement should you focus on developing first?
</p>

<p>
In traditional requirements engineering, there is a whole phase solely dedicated to requirements prioritisation. Agile software development methodologies (such as Scrum) also assumes that you always have your user stories prioritised in your backlog. Essentially, you are doing insertion sort whenever you add a new user story, while also checking that the priority of the existing items do not change as a result of adding the new user story. Each sprint begins with a review of the backlog, before you select among the top prioritised user stories which you should develop in the sprint. If the user story is really big (called an <i>epic</i>), one of the actions you may do is to break it down into more manageable user stories and put these into the backlog.
</p>

<p>
This, of course, does not answer the question since it only explains <i>how</i> you decide, but not <i>on what grounds</i>. Also here, you can probably build a research career on deciding which factors should influence your prioritisation (see, for example, Ruhe and Saliu&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;The art and Science of Release Planning&rdquo; <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>), but a few good starting points are:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Value for the customer</li>
<li>Cost of implementation (Cost and Value can be nicely combined as e.g. Karlsson and Ryan <sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> shows).</li>
<li>Penalty for not implementing</li>
</ul>

<p>
UML/RUP would advocate that you wait with prioritising your requirements and instead prioritise the UML use cases, so that you deliver the most important features first. This does not mean that you need to implement the full flow of events in one go; always keep the Minimum Viable Product in mind.
</p>

<p>
Requirements Engineering is a big topic, and can be quite complex. The introduction above is just meant to get you started. I have, for example, only touched upon the difference between bespoke and market-driven requirements engineering. I have not mentioned any of the challenges involved when you do large scale requirements engineering or very large scale requirements engineering. Nor have I gone through all the different techniques available for eliciting requirements, checklists for analysis, requirements verification, etc. etc. You will get some more information about some of these things in the screencast &ldquo;Requirements Engineering&rdquo;, and for the rest I direct you towards one of the requirements engineering courses offered at BTH.
</p>

<p>
I include some of the UML Use Case learning material in this sprint which will give you a head start for the next sprint, but the focus on what you are expected to do is &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; requirements engineering.
</p>

<p>
A note also about elicitation techniques: I say earlier that you are most likely going to use interviews. Well&#x2026; In this course that&rsquo;s not quite true. In this course you are going to create the requirements yourself, based on a brief system description.

<p>
UML use cases is the first step into Object-Oriented Analysis, according to RUP. The core of a use case is a small set of attributes (name, involved actors, brief description, main course of events, alternative flows). Depending on which version of the course book (Larman) you have you may extend this set with more attributes, and they will have different names (for example Brief (or high-level) use cases and fully dressed (or expanded) use cases) depending on how much information you provide. Outside of this course, it is not important what you call the attributes, or what you call the use cases themselves. What is important, though, is that you establish an order in which to work with the use cases, and that you decide on one standardised format &#x2013; at least for your project, but preferrably for your organisation &#x2013; since this simplifies both readability and the creation of the use cases.

</div>

<p>
The usefulness of use cases lies in that you put a bunch of requirements into a working scenario. A scenario is easier for both the end-users and for the developers to understand. Rather than having to go through all possible alternative branches and edge cases, you focus on describing <i>one instance</i> of interacting with the system. In the example above, it is not &ldquo;any kid&rdquo; that arrives at &ldquo;any ice cream truck&rdquo;. It is one <i>specific</i> kid (Let&rsquo;s call him Bob) arriving at <i>one specific</i> ice cream truck, at <i>one particular time</i>. Yes, we do take some shortcuts by saying that the kid orders &ldquo;an ice cream&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;a vanilla ice cream&rdquo; in order to simplify a bit, but initially we try to avoid anything that may create branches in the main course of events. When we iterate the use case we may see that there are alternative flows to cover (like the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113376/">surprise twist</a> in the example).
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./images/Iwow-that-escalated.jpg" alt="Iwow-that-escalated.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is also important to remember that the main course of events should describe a <i>positive flow</i>, i.e. a flow where the operation succeeds and everyone leaves the use case happily. All the negative flows (for example, the kid does not have enough cash, the ice cream man is out of voodoo dolls, etc.) should be covered as alternative flows.
</p>

<h4 id="orgheadline21"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.1</span> Use Cases as Test Cases</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-1">
<p>
As a developer, you may use this use case straight off as a test case for the system. Find Bob, put him in front of the ice cream truck, and tell him to order an ice cream. If you are able to execute the use case as specified, you have a passing test case. You are of course not done with your tests here, since the use case is not complete. If you think about it, you may select different flavours of ice cream, you may ask for one or several scoops of ice cream, you can ask for a cone or a cup, you can pay with cash or card, and so on. All of these choices ought to be covered in the use case and the corresponding test cases. You may also pay up-front or after delivery, but this may be better represented as two separate use cases.
</p>
</div>

<h4 id="orgheadline22"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.2</span> Use Cases and Business Requirements</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-2">
<p>
Take the use case above. Now quickly tell me which business requirements that are involved.
</p>

<p>
Do the reverse. Take a requirement. Quickly tell me which use cases this requirement is realised in.
</p>

<p>
You can&rsquo;t, can you? This is one of the downsides of use cases if we &ldquo;do things by the book&rdquo;. All is not lost, however. It is relatively easy to augment the use case format to cover for these two situations.
</p>

<p>
The quickest is to add one attribute &ldquo;Dependencies&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Relevant Requirements&rdquo;, or whatever you wish to name it) and simply list all requirements that you are using in the use case. The downside to this approach is that you do not know <i>how</i> the requirements are involved. Let&rsquo;s say that you have a requirement that /&ldquo;As a customer I want to know if there are any nuts in the ice cream because I am allergic to hazelnuts&rdquo;/. When should this requirement be used? When the system informs about the available choices? When the kid orders the ice cream? When the kid has already payed?
</p>

<p>
Another option is to add a column to the main course of events instead:

<p>
Of course, this is more difficult to index (but only slightly and it is easily programmed). You also need not write the entire requirement in the Business Requirements column &#x2013; just the requirement&rsquo;s ID. You may think that for a larger system, this kind of cross-referencing may become difficult because you need to have a pretty firm grasp of the entire requirement&rsquo;s database in order to be able to identify the relevant requirements. However, you would then be assuming (a) that all requirements engineering is done before analysis/design in a waterfall methodology, (b) that you could write the use case without this awareness, and (c) that you cannot add requirements to the use case later and alter the main course of events accordingly. Neither of these are true.
</p>

<p>
You may wonder why you <i>should</i> link use cases and requirements at all? Simply because you are <i>not</i> following a strict waterfall development methodology in a one-off development. When a requirement changes you want to be able to quickly find out where you have designed and implemented the requirement, and when you are implementing the use case you may have more questions, or you may have different idea of how to solve the problem, and then you need to check what was actually stated in the requirement (and who stated it so you can talk to them about it).

<h4 id="orgheadline23"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.3</span> Use Cases and Quality Attributes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-3">
<p>
Another issue that is not included in the default use cases are <i>quality attributes</i>. I suppose you <i>could</i> add it in the regular use case, so that every system response has a subordinate clause specifying the quality constraints. But why not re-use the idea suggested above. Quality requirements are &#x2013; once specified &#x2013; just ordinary requirements, so you can add them in the &ldquo;Business Requirements&rdquo; column for every system response. This makes it easy to add several quality constraints on each system response. Even better, you do not need to have the same quality constraints on the entire use case. For example, presenting the list of ice cream flavours MUST be done within two seconds, but accepting a credit card payment MAY take up to five seconds.

<h4 id="orgheadline24"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.4</span> Use Case Diagrams</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-4">
<p>
Roughly (and don&rsquo;t hold me to this, because there are many situations where this is not true) there will be one use case per feature in the system, for a loose definition of feature. (There, did I weasel out that sentence sufficiently to not say anything meaningful?)
</p>

<p>
This means that there may be quite a lot of use cases, and it may become difficult to get an overview of them if all you have are their textual form. <i>Use Case Diagrams</i> are the UML answer, with the intention of visually clearing up:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What the <i>boundaries</i> are of the system(s) (to which system does which use case belong)</li>
<li>What <i>actors</i> are involved for each system and in each use case</li>
<li>What <i>use cases</i> there are in each system</li>
<li>What <i>relationships</i> there are between use cases, between use cases and actors, and betwen systems.</li>

<h4 id="orgheadline25"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.5</span> Use Case Reuse</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-5">
<p>
When doing larger use cases, you may encounter smaller pieces of processes that are needed by the big use case but are not really dealing with the same problem. For example, what does money and payment have to do with ordering ice-cream (my kids struggle with this one too). There may be alternative ways of doing something, where each way in turn has a number of sub-steps. In order to keep the main use case clean and focused on one problem, and in order to create reusable bits of processes, you can break out behaviour from the main use case into sub-use-cases.

<h4 id="orgheadline26"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.6</span> Use Case Prioritisation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-6">
<p>
Prioritising use cases is at first no different than prioritising requirements or user stories, the difference is that it is the first UML artefact available for you to prioritise. The ground rule is:
</p>

<div class="info">
<p>
First implement use cases that <i>significantly influence</i> the core system architecture.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is pretty much the same advice as you would get in Agile development methodologies, with their focus on a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The question is, of course, what does &ldquo;significantly influence&rdquo; mean? Larman suggests a few guidelines for what may increase the ranking of a use case:
</p>

<div class="info">
<p>
Increase the ranking of a use case if it
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>has direct impact on architectural design
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>example: adds classes to domain layer, require persistent services</li>
</ul></li>
<li>includes risky, time-critical, complex functions</li>
<li>involves new research or technology</li>
<li>represents primary business processes</li>
<li>directly supports revenue or decreased costs</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>
Also remember that you need not implement a use case completely in one iteration. The Minimum Viable Product in the ice cream example is, for example, to get a selection of ice creams and order one. Payment (and authentication etc. etc.) is not part of the MVP, so you can wait with this until a later iteration. If you look at the involved business requirements, this may make more sense to you.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline27" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgheadline27"><span class="section-number-4">2.3.7</span> Story Points</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-3-7">
<p>
I think it is time I introduce another agile concept, namely that of <i>Story Points</i>. You will need this because once you have ranked your use cases, user stories, or requirements, you need a way to determine how much you should commit to in the sprint you are planning for.
</p>

<p>
Decide on a unit. This may be &ldquo;hours to develop&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://spacequest.wikia.com/wiki/Buckazoid">Buckazoids</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_dollar">pieces of eight</a>&rdquo;, or just plain and simple &ldquo;Story points&rdquo;. Take the first item to estimate from your backlog and agree how many story points it is worth. With this as a base, you then have a relative point that you can assess the remainder of your items against (&ldquo;Is it more or less than item #1? How much more? Twice? Thrice?&rdquo;). A common advice is to use a series of possible values for how many story points an item may get. Commonly suggested is to use the fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 45) since it climbs quickly.
</p>

<p>
<i>You will never use the story points outside your team</i>, so it does not matter that they are not absolute. Inside your team, you will use them to measure <i>velocity</i>, i.e. &ldquo;how many story points do you complete per week&rdquo;. First, you now have a nice measure of whether everything is ok in your team and in your product, if you are completing as many story points per week as you usually do (your average velocity). Second, you have a means with which to plan your iterations. If you know that your average velocity is <code>X</code> per week with a confidence interval of <code>+/- 10%</code> and your sprint is planned to last for <code>Y</code> weeks, then you know you will <i>at least</i> be able to commit to <code>0.9X * Y</code> story points in your sprint. Your manager will probably not be happy about this because they expect more from you. So you get closer to the upper bound <code>1.1X * Y</code> instead, and this makes the manager unhappy when you fail to meet your goal. I can&rsquo;t teach you how best to placate your manager, but this will at least give you an idea of which ballpark you have to play in.
</p>

<p>
Of course, when you split up a UML use case into parts that can be implemented in separate iterations, you need to estimate the story points for each part. Good luck!

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-5-2">
<p>
Take a system that you are familiar with. List the use cases in this system in a Use Case Diagram, along with the actors involved. Pick a couple of use cases that requires you to interact with the system in several steps and complete the use cases with a &ldquo;main course of events&rdquo;. Think about alternative flows and add them too.
</p>

<p>
Remember that all actors are not visible. For example, in a messaging application you would have both sender, recipient, and possibly forwarding agent as actors.

Gather your team. Decide on a system that you want to plan (for example, the system that you just listed the use cases for), and engage in a game of <a href="https://www.crisp.se/bocker-och-produkter/planning-poker">Planning Poker</a> to estimate the sizes of all the use cases.
</p>

<p>
Give your use cases a rough priority, e.g. using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method">MOSCoW method</a>, and see if you can divide your thusly created backlog into reasonably sized sprints.
